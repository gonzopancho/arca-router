# Changelog

## v0.4.x – Unified Architecture (current)

- **Unified daemon** (`arca-routerd-v2`): single process managing VPP, FRR, NETCONF, and CLI API
- **Struct-first configuration model** (`internal/model`): Go structs as the canonical config representation
- **Diff-based apply engine** (`internal/engine`): computes minimal changeset between old and new config
- **Plugin southbound** (`internal/southbound`): VPP and FRR drivers implement a common `Plugin` interface
- **gRPC internal API** (`internal/northbound/grpc`): typed RPC between daemon and CLI
- **Thin CLI client** (`arca-cli-v2`): stateless gRPC client replacing direct SQLite access
- **2-phase commit**: validate-then-apply with automatic rollback on failure
- **Backward compatibility**: legacy `cmd/arca-routerd`, `cmd/arca-cli`, `cmd/arca-netconfd` remain functional

## v0.3.x – NETCONF Management & Security (previous)

- NETCONF/SSH subsystem for remote management (RFC 6241)
- Interactive CLI with commit/rollback
- Advanced policy options (prefix-lists, policy-statements)
- Security enhancements: password/SSH auth, RBAC (admin/operator/read-only), rate limiting, audit logging
- Configuration datastore with candidate/running config and commit history
- CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and release

## v0.2.x – Production VPP Integration (previous)

- Real VPP integration via govpp (VPP 24.10)
- FRR integration for dynamic routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, static routes)
- LCP (Linux Control Plane) exposing VPP interfaces to the Linux kernel
- Junos-like configuration syntax (`set` commands)
- arca-cli for operational commands (`show interfaces`, `show route`, etc.)
- Static hardware definition via `hardware.yaml`
- systemd integration with VPP/FRR dependencies
- DEB/RPM distribution for Debian 12 / RHEL 9
